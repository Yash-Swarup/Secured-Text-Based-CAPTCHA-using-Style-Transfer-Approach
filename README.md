# üß† Secured Text-Based CAPTCHA using Style Transfer Approach

## üìò Project Overview

This project proposes a **Style Transfer-based approach** to generate **secure, text-based CAPTCHAs** that are resistant to deep learning and OCR attacks while maintaining readability for human users.  
Traditional CAPTCHAs often fail due to advanced AI solvers like CNNs and GAN-based models that can easily decode distorted text. Our solution applies **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** techniques to introduce complex yet human-recognizable patterns into CAPTCHA text.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

- Traditional text-based CAPTCHAs are **vulnerable** to deep learning and OCR-based attacks.  
- Adding excessive distortion decreases **human usability**.  
- Static CAPTCHAs fail to **adapt to evolving AI-based solvers**.  

---

## üí° Proposed Solution

We integrate **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to generate dynamically stylized CAPTCHAs with:
- Complex textures inspired by artistic styles (e.g., Van Gogh, Cubism, Abstract).  
- Enhanced resistance against machine-based solvers.  
- Maintained readability for human users.  

Additionally, we explore **GAN-based enhancements** to dynamically generate evolving CAPTCHA backgrounds and distortions.

## üß© Methodology

### 1. **Dataset**
- Source: [CAPTCHA Dataset by Wilhelmy & Rosas (2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248380891_captcha_dataset)  
- Contains 200x50 PNG images of 5-character alphanumeric words with noise (blur and lines).

### 2. **Model Components**
- **Neural Style Transfer (NST):** Extracts content and style features from images using CNN layers.  
- **Style Loss & Content Loss Optimization:** Maintains legibility while embedding diverse artistic patterns.  
- **GAN Integration:** Generates dynamic backgrounds and noise textures to prevent pattern learning.  

### 3. **Workflow**
1. Input CAPTCHA ‚Üí  
2. Apply Style Transfer (using pre-trained CNNs) ‚Üí  
3. Optimize for readability and complexity ‚Üí  
4. Generate CAPTCHA image output ‚Üí  
5. Evaluate against CNN/OCR/GAN attacks.
